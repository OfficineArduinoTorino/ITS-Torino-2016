# ITS-Torino-2016
A place for 2016 Physical Computing introduction to ITS students

This github repository is a quick sumup of the introductory Course to Physical Computing and Digital Fabrication organized by Officine Arduino between March and June 2016 for ITS Torino, inside their Mobile App Design.

The Course was developed by Officine Arduino and managed by Davide Gomba. Giacomo Leonzi held the introductory Arduino part, while Elena Pressaco was after the lasercut and Design syllabus. A strong help was given by Lorenzo Romagnoli and Tommaso Laterza for the final rush.

All projects were later presented during the [Torino Mini Maker Faire](makerfairetorino.com)

All the students shared a presentation (later called "scheda") which is reachable [here](http://officinearduinotorino.github.io/ITS-Torino-2016/)

You can give a look at the 2016 programme (italian) or browse the projects in the documentation that will be provided by the students ("schede" section). In this very same github (master branch) you'll be able to find designs and sourcecodes.
