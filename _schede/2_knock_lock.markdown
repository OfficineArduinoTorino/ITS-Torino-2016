#### ABSTRACT:
The idea came from the collaboration with [Crossmedia Factory](http://crossmediafactory.it/),that for the event [Vaporosamente](http://vaporosamente.blogspot.it/) will propose again Sherlock IoT to the public, an experimentation of “immersive storytelling game”, a kind of role game that requires the creativity of the participants to improve their experience users-creators.

This time, the story is set in Turin, in 1834, during the Universal Exposition. Beyond an amazing Steampunk background there is a mysterious society full of secrets. It’s up to the players trying to solve them all.
